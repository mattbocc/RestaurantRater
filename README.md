# Restaurant Rater
In this project I created a full stack application that allows one to rate and review restaurants or establishments in the food/beverage industry. 
I utilized React/Bootstrap to create the frontend and Node.js/PSQL for the backend. Express was used for routing HTTP requests then sending queries 
to the relational database.

Check out the video below for how the app works:
